/* 
  This code generates a random maze using the Recursive Backtracking algorithm.
  It then uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the start
  to the end of the maze. The maze is represented as a grid, where each cell can
  be either a wall or a walkable path.

  The code also includes an interactive user interface that allows the user to
  solve the maze by themselves or let the computer solve it automatically.

  The user can control the movement of an avatar (represented by an 'A') using
  the arrow keys on the keyboard. The avatar can only move through walkable
  paths, and the goal is to reach the end of the maze (represented by an 'E').

  The A* search algorithm uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the
  shortest path from a cell to the goal. It then explores the cells with the lowest
  estimated cost first, in order to reach the goal quicker.

  The code includes various helper functions and classes to handle the maze generation,
  pathfinding, and user interface.

  Note: This code requires a web browser environment to run, as it heavily relies
  on user interaction and DOM manipulation.
